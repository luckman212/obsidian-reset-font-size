# Reset Font Size

## Why

Ever found yourself "zoomed in" on your notes with seemingly no way to get the text back to its normal size? Pressing <kbd>cmd/ctrl+0</kbd> doesn't work, nor does quitting and re-launching Obsidian.

This can happen after accidentally (or intentionally) zooming in or out with the mouse wheel, trackpad, or keyboard shortcuts.

## What

This is a small plugin I wrote that aims to solve that problem by adding a button and a command to reset the font size back to a user-configurable default value. Yes, you can also do this manually from Settings > Appearance > Font Size, but this is faster.

## How

The command can be bound to a hotkey or triggered from the command palette. You can also trigger it from the button on the sidebar ribbon.

### Hotkey

I suggest <kbd>Cmd+Shift+0</kbd> (or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+0</kbd> on Windows) as a keybinding.
